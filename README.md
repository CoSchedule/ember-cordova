## corber

We have started moving the ember-cordova CLI into the corber project, which adds support for other frameworks. This repository is a mirror of the pre-forked, stable ember-cordova. We encourage you to try the corber beta.

Announcement details can be found [here](http://blog.isleofcode.com/announcing-corber-ember-cordova-vue/), the repository [here](https://github.com/isleofcode/corber) and documentation [here](http://corber.io).
