# Ember Cordova

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/isleofcode/ember-cordova.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/isleofcode/ember-cordova)

## corber

We have migrated ember-cordova to the corber project, which adds support for Vue/React/Webpack apps. Ember users will see no feature loss after migration.

Most new features will appear in corber, however we will continue bugfixes in ember-cordova.

We encourage you to migrate to corber.io. This repository is a fork of the last stable ember-cordova release.

Announcement details can be found [here](http://blog.isleofcode.com/announcing-corber-ember-cordova-vue/), the repository [here](https://github.com/isleofcode/corber) and documentation [here](http://corber.io).

## ember-cordova
ember-cordova simplifies building Cordova applications with Ember.js.

Included is a CLI, icon generation & plugins/platforms, bindings to the Cordova platform and a growing ecosystem of Cordova plugins built to work with Ember. It is maintained by Isle of Code in Toronto, with a community of contributors.

It supports Ember 1.13+ and node per [Ember Node LTS Support](http://emberjs.com/blog/2016/09/07/ember-node-lts-support.html)

Given upstream changes in ember-cli, support for ember-cordova stops at 2.13.x. High versions of ember-cli are supported with corber. If you'd like to resolve that issue in ember-cordova, [this corber issue is a good starting point](https://github.com/isleofcode/corber/issues/391).

## Quickstart

`ember install ember-cordova`
